# Decoding Nature

Mapping our world into 'laws of nature', detecting patterns and discovering the 'logic' behind our experience is is the core of science. The computer is for us what the microscope or the telescope had been to the researchers at the dawn of modernity: an enhancement of our mind and senses to understand and simulate these laws. With algorithms and code we can not only build models of the world but play with imaginary alternatives by changing the rules.

We will explore how basic laws of nature can be expressed in code, how complexity unfolds out of very simple algorithms, and how to play with computational models of biology and of our mind.

This is a production-based course that involves programming work both inside and outside of the classroom. During class, code examples will be presented, written, and reviewed. Examples will iteratively build off lessons learned in preceding classes and students will be encouraged to write code, ask questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion.
